##What I learned##
- Cloning: I like the concept of the cloud and syncing your local machine and the cloud, so that you can continously code on your IDE while it goes to GitHub as well.

##What I am still confused about##
- Issues: Are they just comments? If you are able to track bugs, tasks, and even talk about projects, what makes them different/useful? Also, why are project boards not necessary for smaller projects?
